ViReader, a novel Vietnamese MRC system that implementsa transfer learning-based sentence retriever and a XLM-RoBERTa-based answerextractor. As a result, our system outperform the DrQA-based system by 30.83 and 26.10 percentage points in terms of answer prediction EM-score and F1-score, respectively. Significantly, our proposed system outperforms the original XLM-R based MRC system in terms of performance and speed.
